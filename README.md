# Subg-Con
Sub-graph Contrast for Scalable Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning (Jiao *et al.*, ICDM 2020): [https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10273](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10273)


## Overview
Here we provide an implementation of Subg-Con in PyTorch and the geometric deep learning extension library, Pytorch Geometric. The repository is organised as follows:
- `subgcon.py` is the implementation of the Subg-Con pipeline;
- `subgraph.py` is the implementation of subgraph extractor;
- `model.py` is the implementation of components for Subg-Con, including a GNN layer, a pooling layer, and a scoring function;
- `utils_mp.py` is the necessary processing subroutines;
- `dataset/` will contain the automatically downloaded datasets;
- `subgraph/` will contain the processed subgraphs.

Finally, `train.py` puts all of the above together and may be used to execute a full training.
